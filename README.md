# Generate-Proper-Logic-Circuit-Genetic-Algorithm
The project was done individually as a part of Artificial Intelligence course at Tehran University.<br>
The main purpose is to use genetic algorithm and generate an electronic logic circuit, which would produce the exact same result given in truth table for each row of truth table file.
